## Are you looking for new places to go? Follow the goat!
NaviGoat, a play on the word 'navigate,' is a web application that allows users to easily find restaurants and shops near them! Users are able to search for businesses around their current location, as well as any other location they may specify. They can prioritize their searches by distance, rating, and even the number of reviews each location has! Each location displays its rating, number of reviews, distance, pricing, address, and phone number. If geolocation is not enabled on the site and no location is specified, the site will default to places near New York City.

I used Python3 for the back-end of the website. For the front-end, I used Bootstrap,  JavaScript, and custom CSS. The map and recommendation list are implemented using the Yelp Fusion API, as well as the Google Maps JavaScript API with Geolocation. The site is being hosted using DigitalOcean.
